The **first code** solves the coin change problem using dynamic programming and multithreading. It calculates the number of ways to achieve a target sum using a given set of coin denominations, where each denomination has an infinite supply. Multiple threads are used to demonstrate concurrent computation, enhancing performance by dividing the task among threads. User inputs specify the number of coin types, their denominations, and the target sum.

The **second code** simulates a coffee shop scenario using multithreading, where baristas (producers) prepare coffee, customers (consumers) pick it up, and a coffee reviewer samples the coffee. The counter has a maximum capacity of 3, ensuring synchronized interactions using `wait()` and `notify()`. Custom exceptions handle cases like empty counters. The program dynamically adapts to user inputs for the number of coffees prepared by baristas and picked up by customers, creating a realistic and interactive producer-consumer simulation.
